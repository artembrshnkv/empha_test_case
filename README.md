# Test case for Empha 

Start by creating a virtual environment in your project folder by running
```bash
$ virtualenv venv
```
This will install python, pip and common libraries in your project folder.

Next, invoke the source command to activate the environment. 
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Lastly, install the dependencies from the included requirements.txt file by running

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
